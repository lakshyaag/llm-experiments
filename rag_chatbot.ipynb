The channel focuses on teaching higher mathematics from a visual perspective, and on the process of discovery and inquiry-based learning in mathematics, which Sanderson calls \"inventing math\". As of April 2024, the channel has 6.12 million subscribers.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\n\\nSanderson graduated from Stanford University in 2015 with a bachelor\\'s degree in mathematics. He worked for Khan Academy from 2015 to 2016 as part of their content fellowship program, producing videos and articles about multivariable calculus, after which he started focusing his full attention on 3Blue1Brown.\\n\\nIn 2020, Grant Sanderson became one of the creators and lecturers of the MIT course Introduction to Computational Thinking, together with Alan Edelman, David Sanders, James Schloss, and Benoit Forget. The course uses the Julia programming language and Grant Sanderson\\'s animations to explain various topics: convolutions, image processing, COVID-19 data visualization, epidemic modelling, ray tracing, introduction to climate modelling, ocean modelling, and the algorithms that lie behind these topics.\\n\\nIn February 2022, Sanderson determined that the best starting word in the game Wordle was CRANE using information theory. Later, he stated that the code he wrote to determine the best starting word had a bug in it, and the actual best starting word that gives the lowest average score is SALET.\\n\\nIn January 2020, Sanderson delivered a talk in An Evening with Grant Sanderson, hosted by the Stanford Speakers Bureau. Sanderson offered his perspective on engaging with math: instead of prioritizing usefulness, he emphasizes emotion, wonder and imagination. He aims to \"bring life to math\" with visuals, graphics, and animations. In August 2021, Sanderson was one of several featured speakers at SIGGRAPH 2021.\\n\\nIn November 2022, Sanderson delivered a keynote speech, \"What can algorithms teach us about education?\", at the 17th Dutch National Informatics Congress CelerIT hosted by Stichting Nationaal Informatica Congres (SNiC). Sanderson offered his perspective on how mathematics education should evolve in the future and related his findings with the way neural networks learn, he emphasizes the need for students to grasp concepts and understand them.\\n\\n3Blue1Brown started as a personal programming project in early 2015. In an episode of the podcast Showmakers, Sanderson explained that he wanted to practice his coding skills and decided to make a graphics library in Python, which eventually became the open-source project Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine). To have a goal for the project, he decided to create a video with the library and upload it to YouTube. On March 4, 2015, he uploaded his first video. He started publishing more videos and improving the graphics tool.\\n\\nVideos, podcasts and other media\\n\\n3Blue1Brown videos are themed around visualizing math, including pure math such as number theory and topology as well as more applied topics in computer science and physics, The visuals are predominantly generated by Manim, a Python animation library written by Sanderson, though occasionally visuals are drawn from other software such as macOS\\'s Grapher application.\\n\\nThe channel\\'s videos have been featured in Popular Mechanics, ABC News, and Quanta Magazine. Sanderson has appeared on numerous notable podcasts, including Numberphile, Lex Fridman, the Art of Problem Solving, Siraj Raval, and Showmakers.\\n\\nManim is a cross-platform, free and open-source animation engine released under the MIT License. It was initially developed by Grant Sanderson in early 2015.', 'timestamp': '2024-04-25T17:26:36', 'title': '3Blue1Brown - Wikipedia', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3Blue1Brown'}\n",

On this site, you can find written versions of many of these lessons, often with more interactive elements sprinkled in.\\n\\nSome lessons cover standard topics people may be searching for, such as linear algebra, neural networks, calculus, Fourier transforms, quantum mechanics and many more.\\n\\nOther lessons are more purely playful, exploring puzzles and problems with some intrinsic beauty, particularly those which seem quite challenging at first, but where some shift in perspective makes them both doable and beautiful.\\n\\nThe first category aims to motivate math by its usefulness, and the second aims to motivate math as an art form, though of course, the line dividing these two is easily blurred.\\n\\nMy name is Grant Sanderson. These videos, and the animation engine behind them, began as side projects as I was wrapping up my time studying math and computer science at Stanford. After graduating, I worked for Khan Academy producing videos, articles and exercises, primarily focussed on multivariable calculus.

Did he take like one class on the fundamentals of animation?\\n\\nI mean.... it\\'s kinda general programming stuff. Last I checked, manim was based on cairo (though there was talk of replacing that to make it more efficient), and if you know how to program in general, how to read documentation, then building an animation library on top of that isn\\'t particularly technically challenging. It just requires effort and planning, as well as some creativity with how things should look, and Grant has done quite a good job of that.\\n\\nHow would a math major know to look at Cairo?\\n\\nmore replies More replies More replies More replies More replies\\n\\nHe did that by working at Khan Academy doing math related animations (kinda what he does now), and wrote a math animation library (which he uses for creating his animations - called Manim - short for math animations).

What’s more, it created instant millionaires out of about 300 employees. Apple’s stock price at IPO was $22 per share. (read more)\\n\\nBut it was a long road to these millions for Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, both college dropouts, who set out to design a user-friendly personal computer from the garage of Jobs’ parent`s house in Los Altos, California in Silicon Valley.\\n\\nA local computer store chain, The Byte Shop, was planning to sell Steve Jobs’ bare circuit boards for $40 each, but instead was convinced to order 50 of Jobs’ fully assembled Apple I computers, paying $500 on each delivery.\\n\\nWozniak wasted no time in moving on to the Apple II. Released in 1977, the updated model kept many of the innovative features from the duo’s first machines, like the 60 character-per-second display screen and cassette interface, while adding more memory and colors to the display. Apple II sold at a minimum $1,298 price point, setting the stage for much bigger cash flow into a growing Apple.\\n\\nIn May 1980, just five months before its IPO, Apple released the third generation of its computer. Apple III, like Mac computers of today, forwent the cooling fan. Rather, the computer dissipated CPU heat through the machine’s chassis.\\n\\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple stock began trading on the Nasdaq at $22 per share. Steve Jobs, the largest shareholder, made $217 million on the first day of trading. By the end of trading on that Friday afternoon, Apple’s stock price had risen by almost 32%, closing near a stock price of $29 and resulting in a market value of $1.778 billion for Apple.\\n\\n1981 saw Apple’s first shareholder meeting as a public company. Held at the Flint Center at De Anza College in Cupertino. Steve Jobs’ prepared speech was reportedly interrupted several times and eventually devolved into an emotionally-charged rant about respect and betrayal.\\n\\nAfter Apple’s first two-for-one stock split in June 1987, shareholders received two shares at a stock price of $41.50 each for their stock which had closed the previous day at stock price of $78.50. \\n\\nThroughout the 1990’s, Apple stock price would swing violently. Often times falling below as stock price of $10. But by the time the 2000 boom rolled around, Apple’s stock price skyrocketed above the $30 mark.\\n\\nThe year 2000 also brought about Apple’s second stock spell. On June 21, with Apple’s stock price at $101.25, Apple issued two shares to investors at $55.62.\\n\\nFive years later, with Apple stock price at an ever-higher $88.99, Apple issued a third two-for-one stock split. At market close on February 28, Apple’s stock price was $44.88 per share.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the financial crisis of the late 2000’s would spell an end to Apple’s good times. As concerns of Steve Jobs’ deteriorating health proliferated, Apple began diversifying from computers, adding consumer electronics like iPod and iPhone. The App Store would debut in the summer of 2008.\\n\\nFour years later, in September 2012, when Apple’s stock price first broke $700 per share (accounting for stock splits), one share of Apple bought on IPO day would now be eight shares with an impressive overall return rate of 25,439%.\\n\\nThanks to the astronomical rise over the years, Apple split the stock again in June 2014, this time seven-for-one. Three years later, in 2017, with Tim Cook at the helm and a services business providing a bulk of revenue, Apple’s stock price is still steadily climbing.\\n\\nMoody’s Daily Credit Risk Score\\n\\nMoody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score of a company’s credit risk, based on an analysis of the firm’s balance sheet and inputs from the stock market. The score provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk, allowing investors to make better decisions and streamline their work ow. Updated daily, it takes into account day-to-day movements in market value compared to a company’s liability structure.\\n\\nVanguard Group, Inc.

The U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday that it filed a lawsuit accusing the company of behaving like a monopoly in locking in iPhone customers and limiting competitors building hardware and software.

Neuberger Berman Managing Director Dan Flax joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why he believes this legal action will have little impact on Apple shares. Despite the regulatory scrutiny and softening demand Apple is currently grappling with, Flax suggests that the iPhone market remains \"pretty durable.\" He expresses confidence in Apple\\'s ability \"to continue executing well\" with the introduction of new products potentially buoying the stock\\'s price into 2025 despite the current pressures. Flax acknowledges that tech companies earning heavy scrutiny over antitrust concerns is not new.

DA Davidson Managing Director Gil Luria joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the implications of this lawsuit. Luria states that this lawsuit \"is a big deal,\" noting that while Apple has been under regulatory scrutiny before regarding the App Store, the difference this time is that it \"goes to the heart of Apple\" — its iPhone products. According to Luria, the DOJ is accusing Apple of \"a series of practices\" designed to ensure that consumers continue to buy iPhones and not switch to Android devices. However, he says that if Apple were to mitigate some of the concerns raised, it would inevitably weaken the company\\'s position. Luria suggests that in the short term, investors have \"little reason to think\" the lawsuit will impact iPhone sales. However, in the long run, it could \"loosen their hold on\" the smartphone market in the US, impacting prices and promoting Android devices, which could pose \"a big headwind\" to the iPhone market.

Still, many investors might be wondering if AAPL stock is a buy right now. X\\n\\nThe Justice Department sued Apple on March 21, accusing the Cupertino, Calif.-based company of violating antitrust laws with its restrictive iPhone and App Store policies. The lawsuit alleges that Apple\\'s conduct makes it harder for Americans to switch smartphones, undermines innovation for apps, and imposes extraordinary costs on developers, businesses and consumers.\\n\\nIn a statement, Apple said the lawsuit is \"wrong on the facts and the law\" and vowed to \"vigorously defend against it.\"\\n\\nWall Street analysts said the case will be a headline risk for Apple, which has a good chance of beat the rap. But the lawsuit could take three or four years to wind its way through the legal system.\\n\\nApple\\'s List Of Woes\\n\\nOther issues weighing on Apple stock include weak iPhone sales in China and legal problems over its App Store policies in Europe. Investors also are concerned about Apple lacking a strategy for artificial intelligence.\\n\\nApple is playing catch-up with Big Tech rivals in AI, especially generative artificial intelligence. The company\\'s AI initiative is going to be a costly undertaking and profits could take a near-term hit, according to Deepwater Asset Management.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in late February, Apple decided to end development of an autonomous electric car after a decade of work. Apple reportedly spent more than $10 billion on the Apple car project before shutting it down to focus on AI.\\n\\nOn a positive note, Apple returned to sales growth in its fiscal first quarter, thanks to iPhone 15 handset sales and services. Before the Q1 report, Apple\\'s sales had fallen for four straight quarters on a year-over-year basis.\\n\\nBut Apple\\'s sales in China fell 12.9% year over year in the December quarter amid heightened competition from Chinese handset makers.\\n\\nAlso, Loop Capital believes Apple\\'s sales and earnings will decline in calendar 2024 due to soft iPhone sales.\\n\\nApple Opportunities For Growth\\n\\nWith the iPhone business maturing, investors are wondering what the next big growth driver will be for Apple stock.\\n\\nRecently, two businesses have given Apple\\'s sales and profits a boost: services and wearables.\\n\\nIn the December quarter, Apple\\'s services revenue increased 11% to $23.1 billion. At the same time, its hardware sales rose just fraction year over year to $96.5 billion.\\n\\nApple\\'s services include the App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and other offerings.\\n\\nOn Oct. 25, Apple raised prices for multiple subscription services, including Apple TV+ and its Apple One bundles.\\n\\nHowever, Apple is facing antitrust scrutiny in the U.S., Europe and Asia for its App Store policies, including its 30% commission fee. In Europe, Apple must comply with the recently enacted Digital Markets Act.\\n\\nApple Vision Pro Hits The Market\\n\\nMeanwhile, Apple launched its first major new product in nine years on Feb. 2 with Apple Vision Pro. The spatial computing headset starts at $3,499 and is only available in the U.S. for now.\\n\\nApple Vision Pro is part of Apple\\'s push into the wearables market, following the success of the Apple Watch and AirPods wireless earbuds.\\n\\nThe first weekend of availability for Apple Vision Pro saw consumers lined up at Apple retail stores to try out the new spatial computer. The computer goggles combine virtual and augmented reality.\\n\\nThe headset can play virtual-reality content and simulate augmented reality using video pass-through to show the real world. It is designed for entertainment, communications and productivity applications.\\n\\nApple unveiled Vision Pro last June at its Worldwide Developers Conference. But Apple stock fell 0.8% after the announcement. Critics on social media derided the new product as \"nerd goggles.\"\\n\\nWhile the technology is impressive, the high price will limit sales to well-heeled early adopters, analysts said. The killer app for the Vision Pro headset could be watching \"spatial video.\"\\n\\nLaunching the Apple Vision Pro is one of the company\\'s key challenges in 2024. Another is finding a strategy in the burgeoning market for artificial intelligence.\\n\\nApple Earnings Report Mixed\\n\\nLate on Feb. 1, Apple topped Wall Street\\'s estimates for the December quarter, but signaled a sales decline in the March quarter. Apple stock dropped 0.5% in the next trading session.\\n\\nApple earned $2.18 a share on sales of $119.6 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 30. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Apple earnings of $2.10 a share on sales of $118 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Apple earnings increased 16% while sales rose 2%.\\n\\nFor the current quarter, Apple guided to sales of about $90 billion, down 5% from the same period last year. Analysts had been modeling $95.6 billion for the fiscal second quarter.\\n\\nIn the December quarter, Apple\\'s iPhone revenue increased 6% to $69.7 billion and accounted for 58% of the company\\'s total sales.\\n\\nApple\\'s Mac computer sales rose a fraction to nearly $7.8 billion. However, iPad tablet sales plummeted 25% year over year to $7 billion.\\n\\nFinally, revenue from Apple\\'s wearables, home and accessories unit declined 11% to about $12 billion.\\n\\nThe company\\'s next earnings report is due on May 2. That could be a catalyst for Apple stock.\\n\\nAnother potential catalyst will be the company\\'s Worldwide Developers Conference, which will run June 10-14. At WWDC, Apple is likely to reveal its innovations in AI.\\n\\nApple Stock Falls Below $3 Trillion Value\\n\\nIn January 2022, Apple became the first company to reach a market value of $3 trillion. But it failed to stay above that level and didn\\'t return to it until mid-2023.\\n\\nApple stock closed above a $3 trillion market cap for the first time on June 30. However, its current valuation is $2.62 trillion.\\n\\nMicrosoft (MSFT) recently surpassed Apple\\'s market value to become the world\\'s largest company by market capitalization. Microsoft\\'s current market cap is $3.16 trillion, boosted by its leading role in the artificial intelligence megatrend.\\n\\nApple\\'s Storied History\\n\\nApple has been an American success story several times over. First, it ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II. Then it reinvented the PC in the 1980s with the Macintosh.\\n\\nCo-founder Steve Jobs returned to run Apple in 1997 and oversaw a winning streak of innovations that included the iMac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad and the App Store.\\n\\nThe biggest driver of Apple\\'s modern success is the iPhone. The game-changing smartphone, which debuted in 2007, sparked years of massive growth and created a loyal base of customers willing to buy Apple products and services.\\n\\nApple has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices in use today, including well over 1 billion iPhones.\\n\\nExclusive Apple Stock Ratings\\n\\nAAPL stock has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 25 out of 99. The Relative Strength Rating shows how a stock\\'s price performance stacks up against all other stocks over the last 52 weeks.\\n\\nApple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 56 out of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. IBD\\'s Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings of fundamental and technical performance into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\\n\\nApple is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks, which fueled the big stock market rally in 2023.\\n\\nPlus, Apple ranked No. 5 on IBD\\'s 2022 100 Best ESG Companies list. ESG is short for environmental, social and governance.\\n\\nAAPL Stock Technical Analysis\\n\\nLast year, Apple stock climbed 48.2% to 192.53. But AAPL stock ended the regular session April 5 at 169.58.\\n\\nOn Dec. 14, Apple stock notched a record high of 199.62. Shares rose on a positive report from contract manufacturer Foxconn, which assembles Apple\\'s iPhones.\\n\\nIn a negative sign, Apple stock is trading below its 50-day moving average line. Plus, its relative strength line has been falling lately as it underperforms the S&P 500 index.\\n\\nWorse yet, Apple stock is showing the ominous \"death cross\" on its chart.\\n\\nApple stock has an IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D, indicating selling by institutional investors.\\n\\nIs Apple Stock A Buy Right Now?\\n\\nNo, Apple stock is not a buy right now.\\n\\nIt needs to form a new base in the right market conditions before setting a potential buy point.

      "RAGgy:\n",
      "As an AI language model, I cannot give personalized advice or replace the expertise of a licensed professional. However, here are some general tips that you could consider when advising a friend:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Listen actively and attentively: Give your friend your undivided attention and listen without interrupting. Try to understand their perspective and the underlying feelings and emotions behind their words.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Empathize and offer emotional support: Let your friend know that you care about them and that you are there for them. Show empathy by acknowledging their feelings and offering comfort and encouragement.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Help them explore options: Work with your friend to identify the options they have to address their situation. Help them weigh the pros and cons of each option and encourage them to make an informed decision that aligns with their values and goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Provide practical assistance: If appropriate, offer concrete help or assistance to your friend. This could include connecting them with resources, helping them create a plan of action, or simply providing a ride or a shoulder to lean on.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Encourage professional help: If your friend is dealing with a serious issue or struggling with their mental health, encourage them to seek professional help. Offer to help them find a therapist or counselor, or provide information on mental health resources in your area.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Respect their decisions: Ultimately, your friend has agency over their own life and decisions. Respect their choices, even if you don't necessarily agree with them. Continue to offer your support and let them know that you are there for them regardless of the path they choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, every situation is unique, and it's important to tailor your advice and support to your friend's specific needs and circumstances.\n",

But at the same time, other Big Tech stocks such as Meta (META) , Nvidia (NVDA) , and Microsoft (MSFT) have soared.\\n\\nWhile Apple may not have the same significance in artificial intelligence (AI) as Nvidia or Microsoft, the company still maintains a robust position in the technology market and could potentially benefit from this trend in its operations, products, and services.\\n\\nApple Has Wide Moats\\n\\nRenowned investor Warren Buffett has praised Apple as one of the best businesses globally due to its unparalleled brand power. Many Apple customers are willing to pay premium prices, such as $1,500 for a new iPhone, showcasing brand loyalty.\\n\\nBuffett illustrates that this phenomenon is so strong that some would prefer to forgo a second car rather than give up their iPhone.\\n\\nMoreover, Apple\\'s brand power extends beyond its existing products. The potential launch of the Apple Vision Pro, a new product still in its early stages, could further catalyze the strength of the brand.\\n\\nThis brand resilience (which also leads to other factors such as pricing power) contributes to the stability of the company\\'s operations and financial results.\\n\\nThe global recognition of the Apple brand provides the company with a significant competitive advantage in the technology market. Its products are viewed as symbols of status and innovation. This helps drive sales, maintain customer loyalty, and allows Apple to explore new avenues of growth, including those related to generative AI, enhancing its value proposition.\\n\\nOver the years, Apple has been able to expand its revenue significantly, not only from the \"iPhone effect\" but also by unlocking and expanding growth avenues, such as revenue from its services.\\n\\nLooking at the image below, it\\'s possible to notice the factors that have made Apple\\'s \"compounding\" possible. There has been significant growth, particularly in the company\\'s iPhone, Accessories, and Services units.\\n\\nThe growing importance of services such as the App Store and Apple Music not only drives revenue diversification but also increases the company\\'s profitability, as its operating margin is higher.\\n\\nCurrently, this is one of the essential pillars of the Apple investing thesis because there is a strong recurrence. As the user base for Apple\\'s products increases, revenue from services also increases.\\n\\nAccording to TipRanks, of the 26 ratings assigned to Apple, 16 are classified as \"Buy,\" nine as \"Hold,\" and only one as \"Sell.\" The average price target for AAPL is $205, representing a potential upside of 21.25%.\\n\\nConsidering the information above, Apple remains a significant player in the technology landscape, with strong competitive advantages such as its brand and operational resilience. While not as critical in AI as Microsoft and Nvidia, Apple also appears committed to investing in and benefiting from this trend.\\n\\nHowever, its stock has shown a significant decline compared to those of its peers. This means Apple offers greater upside potential when considering the average price target of Wall Street analysts.\\n\\nThese factors alone may not be sufficient for a decision to buy Apple\\'s stock, as other factors such as price, margin of safety, outlook, and investor profile should also be considered.\\n\\n(Disclaimers: this is not investment advice.

Learn More\\n\\nThe company has faced repeated hits to its business but has a promising long-term outlook.\\n\\nApple (AAPL 1.19%) has had a challenging start to 2024, with its shares down 9% year to date. Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company last year, which led to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Its first quarter of 2024 finally broke the streak, with the tech giant posting revenue growth of 2% year over year to $120 billion as it beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.\\n\\nHowever, outperforming estimates haven't been enough to quell investor concerns about other areas of its business. In the first quarter of 2024, Apple's iPhone division reported a 6% rise in total sales, yet fell 13% in China. The East Asian country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.\\n\\nThen, on March 4, Apple's stock slipped 3% in early trading after news broke that the European Commission had hit the company with a $2 billion antitrust fine over concerns for its music streaming service.\\n\\nDespite recent headwinds, Apple remains a leader in tech with dominating brand power and immense financial resources. A recent stock dip could be the perfect time to make a long-term investment in its business and profit from its potential over the next decade.\\n\\nSo here are two reasons to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow.\\n\\n1. The brand power and financial resources to overcome current headwinds\\n\\nApple is a behemoth in consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products.\\n\\nThe popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. This chart shows Apple's free cash flow is considerably higher than some of the top names in tech. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing it to continue investing in its business.\\n\\nWhile declining sales in China are concerning for now, growth in other regions could offset losses over the long term while the company gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple's second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.\\n\\nMoreover, the recent launch of Apple's first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, the Vision Pro, could become a key growth catalyst in the coming years. The VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030. Apple may be new to the industry, but it has a reputation for entering new sectors and quickly rising to dominance.\\n\\nAs a result, an investment in Apple today could be an investment in the future leader of the $20 billion VR market.\\n\\n2. Trading at a better value than its rivals\\n\\nThe tech market is booming, with the Nasdaq-100 technology sector up 11% year to date. Wall Street has grown bullish about the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and improvements in e-commerce, sending countless tech stocks soaring. While this has been beneficial for current investors, it has raised the price of entry for new ones.\\n\\nHowever, recent headwinds have kept Apple's stock at an attractive price point. This chart below shows that Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow are significantly lower than those of its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon. The figures indicate that Apple's shares are trading at a bargain by comparison, offering considerably more value.\\n\\nThese are useful metrics for determining a stock's value as they take into account a company's financial health. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing an organization's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, price-to-free cash flow divides market cap by free cash flow.\\n\\nApple has faced repeated hits to its business over the past year. However, it's on a promising growth path. The company is playing the long game with its venture into VR/AR and expansion in other smartphone markets. Additionally, it has funds to invest heavily in its development.\\n\\nA recent stock tumble has boosted the value of its shares and made it low risk, with Apple worth buying like there's no tomorrow.\\n\\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn More\\n\\nA poor January caps off several lackluster months for the stock. Now, take a step back and look at the bigger picture.\\n\\nIt\\'s not been a particularly great month for Apple (AAPL 0.51%) shareholders. Worried about lagging iPhone sales, the stock was downgraded by Barclays at the very beginning of the year, and then downgraded again by Piper Sandler just a couple of days later.\\n\\nThe shares bounced back a bit from their early January stumble, but they\\'re weakening again now. Indeed, it\\'s been a lackluster past few months for shareholders with the stock sliding back to where it was priced in July of last year. Maybe the company\\'s age and sheer size is finally catching up with it.\\n\\nOr maybe not. Here\\'s a rundown of reasons you might want to use the current lull to load up on Apple stock for the long haul.\\n\\n1. Apple stock is down for all the wrong reasons\\n\\nAs Barclays analyst Tim Long explains of his firm\\'s downgrade, \"We are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix, as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads, and wearables.\" Piper Sandler\\'s worry is more broad-based. Analyst Harsh Kumar notes, \"We believe that first-half 2024 will be challenging for the analog market, handset, and consumer end markets.\"\\n\\nIn both cases, so-so demand for the iPhone 15 now portends so-so prospects for the iPhone 16 likely to debut later this year. And it\\'s not like the worry is an unreasonable one; the analysts\\' points are well taken.\\n\\nIn both cases, however, the concerns look past a key quirky point about the iPhone. That is, demand for the device ebbs and flows not so much with the calendar or the economy, but with the device\\'s longevity and capability. Some observers suggest many consumers may be holding out for the iPhone 16, which is widely expected to boast more memory, a better processor, and a superior camera.\\n\\nIn this same vein, Morgan Stanley analysts noted last year that there\\'s incredible \"pent-up demand from consumers deferring their iPhone purchase from FY23 [ended in September].\" Morgan Stanley\\'s number-crunching further suggests the iPhone\\'s replacement cycle now stands at a record-breaking 4.4 years, meaning many iPhone fans simply can\\'t wait much longer to upgrade their device.\\n\\nIn other words, Apple\\'s iPhone sales could be pleasantly surprising come late 2024. And for what it\\'s worth, even the demand for Apple\\'s iPhone 15 may be better than some of the recent rhetoric suggests. Technology market research outfit IDC reported that after the stock\\'s two big downgrades, fourth-quarter shipments of iPhones jumped to a two-year high of 80.5 million.\\n\\nData source: IDC. Chart by author. Figures are in millions.\\n\\nPerhaps Morgan Stanley\\'s argument for pent-up iPhone demand holds more water than it\\'s getting credit for today.\\n\\n2. It\\'s cash-rich with modest debt\\n\\nIt might be growth-challenged right now, but there\\'s no company better equipped to shrug off the impact of such a headwind.\\n\\nAs a reminder, Apple isn\\'t just the world\\'s biggest company, sporting a market capitalization of just under $3 trillion. It\\'s also still the world\\'s most profitable company. It turned last fiscal year\\'s revenue of $383 billion into net income of $97 billion, more or less mirroring the prior year\\'s results. That\\'s huge. It\\'s also got a little over $60 billion worth of cash or highly liquid cash-like holdings on its books.\\n\\nBut what about debt? It\\'s sitting on just a little less than $100 billion in long-term debt, and another $49 billion in other long-term liabilities. That\\'s also huge -- by other company\\'s standards. For a business of Apple\\'s size and caliber, however, it\\'s enviable. This mega-company\\'s balance sheet and reliable income stream mean it\\'s not forced to make short-term decisions just to survive, only to create bigger problems down the road.\\n\\nSaid another way, access to current and future cash flow provides Apple with a strategic advantage many of its competitors simply don\\'t have right now.\\n\\n3. Apple\\'s business model -- and mindset -- is evolving\\n\\nThe third reason to buy Apple stock like there\\'s no tomorrow? It\\'s a bit philosophical, but evident when you make a point of looking for it. That is, the company\\'s business model is evolving from one merely focused on devices to a cultural, solutions-oriented one.\\n\\nThis idea isn\\'t readily evident with just a superficial glance. The iPhone still accounts for a little over half of the company\\'s revenue, after all. Dig deeper, though. Apple\\'s doing things to expand its digital ecosystem that drives a combination of hardware and software sales.\\n\\nYes, the growth of its services arm is an example of this shift. While digital goods and services may only account for about 20% of its total top line, profit margins for this business are about three times wider than they are on sales of physical products. This is only a sampling of the paradigm shift underway, however.\\n\\nConsumer-oriented cloud storage, high-performance video gaming, the continued development of its virtual reality tech called Apple Vision (despite any apparent meaningful demand for it), ongoing tinkering with artificial intelligence, and even semi-autonomous vehicles are all projects still on Apple\\'s plate, even when they don\\'t have to be.\\n\\nThis degree of speculative R&D is relatively new for Apple. Perhaps without even fully knowing how or when these efforts might pay off, the company is positioning itself to be an important technology player in an ever-changing future.\\n\\n4. The most important reason is still the most important reason\\n\\nThe fourth and final reason to step into new stakes in Apple stock right now, however, isn\\'t a new one at all. That is, this is still Apple. Its brand and name remain among the world\\'s best-known -- and for good reason. It\\'s fostered incredible loyalty to its products and services by building superior products and delivering superior service. Its tech just works.\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t necessarily mean the stock\\'s immune to an occasional bout of weakness. It\\'s gone nowhere for the past six months, as a reminder, and was recently on the receiving end of a couple of key analyst downgrades -- analysts who were concerned about its near-term numbers.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the sort of stuff long-term investors should sweat too much, though. True long-termers should aim to own stakes in quality companies, using near-term weakness in their underlying stocks to establish those positions. And Apple at its worst is still better than many companies at their best.\\n\\nIn other words, now\\'s your chance to get into a great pick at a bit of a discount.\\n\\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Still, many investors might be wondering if AAPL stock is a buy right now. X\\n\\nThe Justice Department sued Apple on March 21, accusing the Cupertino, Calif.-based company of violating antitrust laws with its restrictive iPhone and App Store policies. The lawsuit alleges that Apple\\'s conduct makes it harder for Americans to switch smartphones, undermines innovation for apps, and imposes extraordinary costs on developers, businesses and consumers.\\n\\nIn a statement, Apple said the lawsuit is \"wrong on the facts and the law\" and vowed to \"vigorously defend against it.\"\\n\\nWall Street analysts said the case will be a headline risk for Apple, which has a good chance of beat the rap. But the lawsuit could take three or four years to wind its way through the legal system.\\n\\nApple\\'s List Of Woes\\n\\nOther issues weighing on Apple stock include weak iPhone sales in China and legal problems over its App Store policies in Europe. Investors also are concerned about Apple lacking a strategy for artificial intelligence.\\n\\nApple is playing catch-up with Big Tech rivals in AI, especially generative artificial intelligence. The company\\'s AI initiative is going to be a costly undertaking and profits could take a near-term hit, according to Deepwater Asset Management.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in late February, Apple decided to end development of an autonomous electric car after a decade of work. Apple reportedly spent more than $10 billion on the Apple car project before shutting it down to focus on AI.\\n\\nOn a positive note, Apple returned to sales growth in its fiscal first quarter, thanks to iPhone 15 handset sales and services. Before the Q1 report, Apple\\'s sales had fallen for four straight quarters on a year-over-year basis.\\n\\nBut Apple\\'s sales in China fell 12.9% year over year in the December quarter amid heightened competition from Chinese handset makers.\\n\\nAlso, Loop Capital believes Apple\\'s sales and earnings will decline in calendar 2024 due to soft iPhone sales.\\n\\nApple Opportunities For Growth\\n\\nWith the iPhone business maturing, investors are wondering what the next big growth driver will be for Apple stock.\\n\\nRecently, two businesses have given Apple\\'s sales and profits a boost: services and wearables.\\n\\nIn the December quarter, Apple\\'s services revenue increased 11% to $23.1 billion. At the same time, its hardware sales rose just fraction year over year to $96.5 billion.\\n\\nApple\\'s services include the App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and other offerings.\\n\\nOn Oct. 25, Apple raised prices for multiple subscription services, including Apple TV+ and its Apple One bundles.\\n\\nHowever, Apple is facing antitrust scrutiny in the U.S., Europe and Asia for its App Store policies, including its 30% commission fee. In Europe, Apple must comply with the recently enacted Digital Markets Act.\\n\\nApple Vision Pro Hits The Market\\n\\nMeanwhile, Apple launched its first major new product in nine years on Feb. 2 with Apple Vision Pro. The spatial computing headset starts at $3,499 and is only available in the U.S. for now.\\n\\nApple Vision Pro is part of Apple\\'s push into the wearables market, following the success of the Apple Watch and AirPods wireless earbuds.\\n\\nThe first weekend of availability for Apple Vision Pro saw consumers lined up at Apple retail stores to try out the new spatial computer. The computer goggles combine virtual and augmented reality.\\n\\nThe headset can play virtual-reality content and simulate augmented reality using video pass-through to show the real world. It is designed for entertainment, communications and productivity applications.\\n\\nApple unveiled Vision Pro last June at its Worldwide Developers Conference. But Apple stock fell 0.8% after the announcement. Critics on social media derided the new product as \"nerd goggles.\"\\n\\nWhile the technology is impressive, the high price will limit sales to well-heeled early adopters, analysts said. The killer app for the Vision Pro headset could be watching \"spatial video.\"\\n\\nLaunching the Apple Vision Pro is one of the company\\'s key challenges in 2024. Another is finding a strategy in the burgeoning market for artificial intelligence.\\n\\nApple Earnings Report Mixed\\n\\nLate on Feb. 1, Apple topped Wall Street\\'s estimates for the December quarter, but signaled a sales decline in the March quarter. Apple stock dropped 0.5% in the next trading session.\\n\\nApple earned $2.18 a share on sales of $119.6 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 30. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Apple earnings of $2.10 a share on sales of $118 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Apple earnings increased 16% while sales rose 2%.\\n\\nFor the current quarter, Apple guided to sales of about $90 billion, down 5% from the same period last year. Analysts had been modeling $95.6 billion for the fiscal second quarter.\\n\\nIn the December quarter, Apple\\'s iPhone revenue increased 6% to $69.7 billion and accounted for 58% of the company\\'s total sales.\\n\\nApple\\'s Mac computer sales rose a fraction to nearly $7.8 billion. However, iPad tablet sales plummeted 25% year over year to $7 billion.\\n\\nFinally, revenue from Apple\\'s wearables, home and accessories unit declined 11% to about $12 billion.\\n\\nThe company\\'s next earnings report is due on May 2. That could be a catalyst for Apple stock.\\n\\nAnother potential catalyst will be the company\\'s Worldwide Developers Conference, which will run June 10-14. At WWDC, Apple is likely to reveal its innovations in AI.\\n\\nApple Stock Falls Below $3 Trillion Value\\n\\nIn January 2022, Apple became the first company to reach a market value of $3 trillion. But it failed to stay above that level and didn\\'t return to it until mid-2023.\\n\\nApple stock closed above a $3 trillion market cap for the first time on June 30. However, its current valuation is $2.62 trillion.\\n\\nMicrosoft (MSFT) recently surpassed Apple\\'s market value to become the world\\'s largest company by market capitalization. Microsoft\\'s current market cap is $3.16 trillion, boosted by its leading role in the artificial intelligence megatrend.\\n\\nApple\\'s Storied History\\n\\nApple has been an American success story several times over. First, it ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II. Then it reinvented the PC in the 1980s with the Macintosh.\\n\\nCo-founder Steve Jobs returned to run Apple in 1997 and oversaw a winning streak of innovations that included the iMac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad and the App Store.\\n\\nThe biggest driver of Apple\\'s modern success is the iPhone. The game-changing smartphone, which debuted in 2007, sparked years of massive growth and created a loyal base of customers willing to buy Apple products and services.\\n\\nApple has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices in use today, including well over 1 billion iPhones.\\n\\nExclusive Apple Stock Ratings\\n\\nAAPL stock has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 25 out of 99. The Relative Strength Rating shows how a stock\\'s price performance stacks up against all other stocks over the last 52 weeks.\\n\\nApple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 56 out of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. IBD\\'s Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings of fundamental and technical performance into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\\n\\nApple is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks, which fueled the big stock market rally in 2023.\\n\\nPlus, Apple ranked No. 5 on IBD\\'s 2022 100 Best ESG Companies list. ESG is short for environmental, social and governance.\\n\\nAAPL Stock Technical Analysis\\n\\nLast year, Apple stock climbed 48.2% to 192.53. But AAPL stock ended the regular session April 5 at 169.58.\\n\\nOn Dec. 14, Apple stock notched a record high of 199.62. Shares rose on a positive report from contract manufacturer Foxconn, which assembles Apple\\'s iPhones.\\n\\nIn a negative sign, Apple stock is trading below its 50-day moving average line. Plus, its relative strength line has been falling lately as it underperforms the S&P 500 index.\\n\\nWorse yet, Apple stock is showing the ominous \"death cross\" on its chart.\\n\\nApple stock has an IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D, indicating selling by institutional investors.\\n\\nIs Apple Stock A Buy Right Now?\\n\\nNo, Apple stock is not a buy right now.\\n\\nIt needs to form a new base in the right market conditions before setting a potential buy point.

As one of the best-known brands in the world, the business sells some of the most in-demand hardware products that consumers pay premium prices to own.\\n\\nApple shares have made for a fantastic investment over the years, climbing 817% in the last decade. And more recently, they rose 48% in 2023, beating the Nasdaq Composite.\\n\\nBut before you rush to buy this FAANG stock in 2024, here are four things you need to know.\\n\\n1. The importance of the iPhone\\n\\nAlthough the company sells a variety of hardware products, like the Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, and iPad, Apple is still incredibly dependent upon the iPhone. In the last fiscal year (ended Sept. 30), the business generated 52% of its revenue from the flagship smartphone.\\n\\nFrom a profitability perspective, this is a good thing. The iPhone only represents about 20% of global smartphone shipments, but due to its pricing power, it accounts for roughly 80% of the industry's operating income. This helps explain why Apple is such a profitable enterprise.\\n\\nHowever, the iPhone is in a mature stage in its life cycle. With new upgrades having fewer game-changing features, it's easier for consumers to choose not to update their phones every year, instead holding on to their existing ones for longer.\\n\\nWhat makes Apple a truly great business is not just its hardware products, but the entire ecosystem. And a key aspect of this is the company's growing services segment. This division includes things like Apple Pay, iCloud, News, Music, and TV+.\\n\\nServices have been expanding at a faster rate than products in recent times. In fiscal 2023, services saw revenue increase by 9%, representing 22% of the overall company's sales. As more of Apple's revenue comes from services, it can be a boon for profitability, as this division carries a stellar gross margin of 71%.\\n\\nPerhaps more importantly, Apple's services drive customer loyalty and stickiness. They give consumers less reason to leave for offerings from competitors.\\n\\n3. Aggressive share repurchaser\\n\\nI've mentioned how profitable Apple is. In the past 10 years, the company's operating margin has averaged a superb 27.9%. This isn't what you're used to seeing from a typical consumer electronics business. It points to Apple's strong brand and differentiation.\\n\\nAdditionally, Apple generates copious amounts of free cash flow (FCF). In just the last three fiscal years, FCF totaled a whopping $304 billion. Remember, this is the money left over after the business reinvests in growth opportunities. And it affords Apple financial flexibility that other companies can only dream about.\\n\\nManagement has used this FCF to aggressively buy back stock. Last fiscal year, nearly $78 billion went toward repurchasing shares. And in the last five years, the company's outstanding share count has been reduced by 21%.\\n\\n4. Expensive valuation\\n\\nWhile it's difficult to find reasons not to like Apple's business, there's one important reason that investors should hesitate before buying the stock: valuation.\\n\\nAs of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.8. This is significantly more expensive than Apple's trailing-10-year average of 20.8. And it represents a huge premium to the S&P 500.\\n\\nIt's challenging to be optimistic about Apple generating market-beating returns going forward when the valuation is so high. This is especially true given how mature the company is these days, with more muted growth prospects than it had in past years.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\\n\\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\\n\\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 8, 2024\\n\\nNeil Patel and his clients have no position in any of the stocks mentioned.
