First, we know that she bought 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday, so she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils.

First, we calculate the discounted price for an officer who has served at least a year. This is 85 * 0.8 = 68. Then, we calculate the additional discount for an officer who has served at least three years. This is 68 * 0.75 = 51. Finally, the officer has to pay this final price of 51.\\nAnswer: $51\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Martha's cat catches 3 rats and 7 birds. Cara's cat catches 3 less than five times as many animals as Martha's cat. How many animals does Cara's cat catch?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\\x1b\u001b[0m\u001b[32m[\u001b[0m\u001b[32m32m find out how many animals Cara's cat catches. First, we know that Martha's cat catches 3 rats and 7 birds, for a total of 10 animals. Then, we know that Cara's cat catches 3 less than five times as many animals as Martha's cat, which is 5 * 10 - 3 = 47 animals.\\nAnswer: 47\\x1b\u001b[0m\u001b[32m[\u001b[0m\u001b[32m0m\\n\\n\\n\"\u001b[0m"

He inherited Kinnairdy Castle in 1664. Three of his twenty-nine children became mathematics professors. He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as \"being destructive to the human species\". Copies and details of the model no longer exist. Gregory's use of a barometer to predict farming-related weather conditions led him to be accused of witchcraft by Presbyterian ministers from Aberdeen, although he was never convicted.»\n",
      "[2] «David Gregory (footballer, born 1970) | Born in Polstead, Gregory began his career at Ipswich Town, making 32 appearances between 1987–1995. He made two appearances on loan at Hereford United and three appearances at Peterborough United after leaving Ipswich. He joined Colchester United in 1995 and spent seven years at Layer Road, making 226 league appearances and scoring 19 goals. Gregory helped the U's to their first league promotion for 22 years in 1998 when he stepped up to put Colchester ahead from the spot in the Third Division playoff final. Gregory made history along with Neil as the first pair of brothers in a play-off final in the same match. His brother Neil joined the U's in 1998 and played alongside David until 2000. Gregory featured regularly in the first team until he cracked a bone in his foot playing against Port Vale in March 2002 and failed to recover fitness by the summer break. He again teamed up with his brother Neil at Canvey Island in July 2002.»\n",
      "[3] «Roughan Castle | Roughan Castle is a castle a mile outside Newmills, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, on the Dungannon to Stewartstown road. It was built about 1618 by Sir Andrew Stewart (d.1639), 2nd Lord Castlestewart, eldest son of Andrew Stewart (1580-1629) the third Lord Ochiltree, 1st Lord Castlestewart who came from Scotland during the plantation and established the nearby town of Stewartstown. Andrew Stewart junior acquired the land of Ballokevan from Robert Stewart between 1610 and 1619 and built his castle overlooking Roughan Lough. It is a small square castle, three storeys high with a central tower 20 ft square, flanked by thick rounded towers at each corner.»\n",

The 16th-century Kinnaird Castle was converted in 1787 for use as the Kinnaird Head Lighthouse, the first lighthouse in Scotland to be lit by the Commissioners of Northern Lights.

Gregory helped the U\\'s to their first league promotion for 22 years in 1998 when he stepped up to put Colchester ahead from the spot in the Third Division playoff final. Gregory made history along with Neil as the first pair of brothers in a play-off final in the same match. His brother Neil joined the U\\'s in 1998 and played alongside David until 2000.
